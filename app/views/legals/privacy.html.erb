        1. General Privacy Policy Information
    </h2>
     
    <p> 
        At Nucifera, we respect your privacy and we are 100% committed to providing effective security for the information you provide to   our website. We use state of the art software to protect our members from electronic fraud and other security risks. We never disclose any information provided to us to any agencies, nor will we sell information that we obtain from you. Please read on for more details on our privacy policy.
    </p>
    
    <p>

It is important for you to understand what information we collect about you during your visit and what we do with that information. Please note that your visit to our Website is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions and that different policies may apply to information that we collect offline.
    </p>
    
    <p>  
        When required by law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, we reserve the right to disclose any information, including personally identifiable information; to protect Nucifera (this includes affiliates, or brand, or all of its assets without limitation in the event of a transfer of control of Nucifera Company) or during emergencies when safety is at risk, or for credit fraud protection and risk reduction purposes

        2. Information Collection and Use
    </h2>
    
    <p>
        When you sign up for any programs on the Nucifera Website, we need to know your name, e-mail address, and mailing address. This information allows us to establish an individual account for you. When you want to purchase products, we need to know your credit card number and expiration date in order to process you transactions. These important pieces of information are only for your use and will not be given out to anyone else under any circumstances. We only collect personally identifiable information about you via this Website when you provide it in connection with a request for a product, service, donation or information. For example, if you decide to place an order, we will ask for your delivery and billing address, phone number(s), email address, credit card number and its expiration date. If you decide to complete a user registration form or survey, we may ask you for information such as your contact information (e.g., name, e-mail address and mailing address), age group or birth date. When you submit your personally identifiable information on this Website, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. Nucifera companies may use the information that you provide to fulfil your request for a product, information, donation, or other services, or respond to an email or other request, as well as to create and deliver to you our newsletters or surveys, communications containing product information, usage tips or promotions, help improve our website(s) or services, or customize visitors experience at our website(s). Personal Credit card or other account information that you provide will be kept confidential and will not be shared with third parties unless you authorize us to do so, or if it is necessary to fulfil our responsibilities including, but not limited to, delivering a product or service that you order. If you prefer not to receive email marketing communications from us or from third parties, please see Section 8 bellow. You have the ability to opt-out of receiving communications from Nucifera (or third parties who may assist us) relating to a specific order, donation, or request for a product or service. If you would prefer that we not collect any personally identifiable information from you please do provide us with any such information.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We may also collect, store or accumulate certain non-personally identifiable information concerning your use of the Website, such as information regarding which of our pages are most popular. Information gathered may be used in aggregate form for internal business purposes, such as generating statistics and developing marketing plans. We may share or transfer such aggregate, non-personally identifiable information with or to our affiliates, licensees or partners.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Website is intended for adults. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. However, if the parent or guardian of a child under 13 believes that the child has provided us with personally identifiable information, the parent or guardian of that child should contact us at support@nucifera.co.uk if they want this information deleted from our files so that it is not in retrievable form. If we otherwise obtain knowledge that we have personally identifiable information about a child under 13 in retrievable form in our files, we will delete that information from our existing files so that it is not retrievable.
    </p>

    <h2>
        3. Ensuring Your Security
    </h2>
    
    <p>
        We use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an advanced security protocol that protects your credit card information and ensures secure online ordering. SSL Internet connections are encrypted, and thus protect all credit card ordering information, including your name, address and credit card number, so no one can read it in transit. We use secure technology, privacy protection controls, and restrictions on employee access, to safeguard your personal information.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
        4. Safe Shopping Guarantee
    </h2>
    
    <p>
        We guarantee that every online transaction you make will be “100% safe”. This means you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at our online store. It is determined that under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, we will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. We will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
    </p>

        5. Technology Utilized
    </h2>
    
    <p>
        There are two commonly used technologies used on this site, clear gifs and cookies. We use these to monitor the performance of the site and to measure its effectiveness. “Cookies” are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. We do not use cookies to obtain any personally identifying information. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent this. Please be assured that accepting a cookie does not give us access to your computer or personal information under any circumstances. If you disable cookies, you may be unable to order or use other features of our sites. If you experience any problems, please email us at support@nucifera.co.uk.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to users’ personally identifiable information but just tell us if you may have seen one of our ads online.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
        6. Third Parties
    </h2>
    
    <p>
        We may rely on other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include data analysis firms, customer support specialists, web-hosting companies, and fulfillment companies (e.g., companies that fill product orders or coordinate mailings). We may share personally identifiable information with such third parties as appropriate for them to perform their functions, but they may not use such information for any other purpose. We may also share personally identifiable information with marketing partners or other direct marketers, so they can send you notices about their products or services. If you do not want to receive email-marketing communications, see section 8 below for opt-out information.
    </p>

    <h2>
        7. Notification of Changes
